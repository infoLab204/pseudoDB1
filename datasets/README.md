# Data Download Instructions
This section outlines the procedures for acquiring reference sequences, sample data, and SNP databases (dbSNPs) for the ten species listed below. While the workflow is demonstrated using a single-sample example within a Unix/Linux environment, the same logic applies to multiple samples. When all necessary datasets are completely downloaded, the anticipated directory organization is highlighted in Fig 1. Within the provided examples, executable commands are contained in code blocks, and explanatory comments are denoted by a # prefix. Following successful data acquisition, please navigate to the install_workflow directory to set up the environment and initiate the variant calling pipeline.
