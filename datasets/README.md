# Data Download Instructions
This section outlines the procedures for acquiring reference sequences, sample data, and SNP databases (dbSNPs) for the ten species listed below. While the workflow is demonstrated using a single-sample example within a Unix/Linux environment, the same logic applies to multiple samples. When all necessary datasets are completely downloaded, the anticipated directory organization is highlighted in Figure 1. Within the provided examples, executable commands are contained in code blocks, and explanatory comments are denoted by a # prefix. Following successful data acquisition, please navigate to the install_workflow directory to set up the environment and initiate the variant calling pipeline.

Target Species: bear, cattle, chickpea, human, komodo, palm, rice, sheep, stevia, and swan_goose.


This section details the steps required to download the reference sequence, sample data, and SNP databases (dbSNP) for ten species listed below. The process is illustrated for a single sample in a Unix/Linux-based system, with the expected directory structure shown in Fig. 1. Note that commands are presented in code boxes, while explanatory comments are prefixed with #. Once the data is acquired, return to the install_workflow directory to install essential software and initiate the variant calling workflow.    <br>
